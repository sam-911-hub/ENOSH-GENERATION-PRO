      <h2>Core Values</h2>
      <p>We are saved by faith in God's only son, Jesus Christ. We believe that Jesus' blood shed on the cross provides the sole basis for forgiveness of sin. Therefore, God freely offers salvation to those who place their Faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>The salvation of humanity is completely a work of God's free grace; it is no way the result of human works or goodness. Each person can receive salvation by placing their Faith in Jesus Christ the son of God.</p>
      <p>We believe that the entire Bible is inspired, inerrant word of God and that people were moved by the Spirit of God to write the very words of scripture.</p>
      <h3>Enosh Generation will work to:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Share the gospel of Jesus Christ as the foundation of true renewal and hope in life by uniting youths and also empowering them to serve as they are called.</li>
        <li>Love all people unconditionally as Christ did without regard to race, history or current conditions.</li>
        <li>Offer safe and loving platforms for youth, volunteers and staff that produce spiritual growth.</li>
        <li>Operate a ministry that honors God and is above reproach in its fiscal responsibility, integrity and commitment to the community.</li>
      </ul>
